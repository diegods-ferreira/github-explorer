<p>This app was developed in the first <strong>React</strong> application creation training module of Rocketseat's Bootcamp GoStack. There, it is possible to create a list with several repositories of different users from GitHub. Just enter <code>username/repository-name</code> and click the <strong>Pesquisar</strong> button. When clicking on a repository in the list, the user will be taken to the details page of that repository, which has information such as number of <i>stars</i>, number of <i>forks</i>, number of open <i>issues</i> and a list of those <i>issues</i>.</p>
<p>Below are some GIFs to illustrate the application.</p>
